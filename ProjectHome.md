This is a 3D map editor, that works with all your sprites and shows your work in real time.
There are known issues, e.g. refresh method is extremely slow & buggy. There is no tile highlight etc.

How it works: You set up your tile settings, then simply click on the tile you wish to edit.

How it should work:

a) You define your tile settings and on mouse over you can accurately see the tile you're going to change.

b) Faster/less buggy refresh

c) Ability to define width/height/radius of the tile, so you can change large proportions of the site with ease.


This is the first step of my path to Open Source. There are a lot of projects I want to OS, and they depend on the feedback I get from this.
